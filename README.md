1.	Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

The purpose of the project is to analyze the historical data by focusing on key criterion; the launch date, funds raised and goal achieved through various campaigns and the success rate of each campaign.
Also, the period of teh year (months) in which these campaigns were most successful. These are critical to decide before creating data set or preparing charts/graphs.

2.	Analysis and Challenges: Explain how you performed your analysis using images and links to code, as well as any challenges you encountered and how you overcame them.
If you had no challenges, describe any possible challenges or difficulties that could be encountered.

Analysis:
For the 1st graph “Theater Outcomes by Launch Date”, it is derived that the most successful campaigns were in the month of May and zero cancellation in the month of October.
Having a visual representation makes it more clear to make a decision on the timeframe of the year to have such fundraising campaigns which saves time.
It gives maximum expected output for the business.

For the 2nd graph “ Outcomes Based on Goals”, it can be derived that % successful  was greater when the goal was in the range of less than 20K which signifies that with less goal of fundraising
it was comparatively achievable than with the higher goal. A graphical representation of any data makes it more visibly acceptable and  provides good depth and breadth of the data to
set the objectives or future business plans.

Challenges:
When I was using “countifs” function, there were too many arguments and manually entering those arguments was challenging as validating the argument with result if the data set is huge (eg: in millions),
how to ensure that the argument is correct to derive the correct dataset and the expected output.

3.	Results: Answer the following questions in complete and coherent sentences.

o	What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date?
- The successful campaigns has a higher ratio across all the months as compared to failed or canceled, however, most successful campaigns happened in the month of Feb, May and June.
It concludes that these are the months Louise can focus to do fundraising activity to have a higher rate of return.
o	What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
– The goals when set to less than 20K were most successful as compared to goals when set between the range of 25k-50k.

o	What are some limitations of this dataset?
- While having a great amount of data, it is imperative that the format of the data is widely acceptable format in the systems and different coding platforms/software.
The conversion of date using Unix timestamp was helpful, however, while converting this date, not sure if it converted in Universal timezone or what is the standard timezone conversion.
It is important that the timezone is correctly calculated especially if the analysis is related to the time of the day or week or the timezone where analysis needs to be conducted and the outcome will be used to make any decision.

o	What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

-	I believe that the analysis was required in order to use the historical data to be able to meet the goal when approaching the deadline for the next campaign.
Hence, any chart/graph which concludes that the immediate month and possibility of using the most successful channel from primary category and greater amount of average donation would have given more detailed and
helpful outcome to meet the deadline with a higher probability of meeting the fundraising amount.
